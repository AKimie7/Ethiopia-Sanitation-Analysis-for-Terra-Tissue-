### The substantial strain on the nation's sanitation systems is due to the country's increased population and expanding cities. Only 7% of Ethiopians (4% in the countryside and 20% in metropolitan areas) have the opportunity to practice basic hygiene. Public defecation is still practiced by 38% of the people in the countryside and 7% of those living in cities. However, there has been an enormous achievement in reducing the defecation rate in public. Over the years, the percentage dropped from 79% to 22% of the general populace as seen from figure 2 (UNICEF Ethiopia, n.d.). The line plot created using Plotly on PyCharm illustrates the trends in coverage of sanitation facilities across different wealth quintiles (UNICEF Sanitation, 2022). Key findings indicate overall improvement in coverage for all wealth quintiles. 'At least basic' coverage tends to be higher in wealthier quintiles. 'Open defecation' shows a significant decline across all quintiles. The 'Poor' and 'Poorest' quintiles face challenges in achieving higher coverage compared to 'Middle,' 'Rich,' and 'Richest.

### The density heatmap, created using Plotly in PyCharm, provides a visual representation of sanitation levels across different regions of Ethiopia. The map highlights areas where sanitation levels are low and identifies hotspots with lower sanitation levels. As seen, the SNNP region has one of the lowest levels of improved sanitation in the country. Research has shown that inadequate access to clean water and sanitation is associated with considerable economic costs and a higher incidence of diarrheal diseases (Azage et al., 2020), due to the high levels of contamination in groundwater, as shown in figure 4. Groundwater supplies over 90% of Ethiopia's homes and corporate needs, that is why the rate of diarrhea is high (Ethiopia, 2020). As a result, only 39.3% of households in SNNPR have access to improved drinking water, and only 8% have access to better sanitation.

## Sanitation Facilities Dsitribution (2018) - Pie Chart created using a UNICEF dataset

### The Figure displays the types of toilet facilities used by the rural population in 2018. The chart indicates that an alarming 53.5% of the rural population use a bucket as a toilet facility, 28.8% practice open defecation, and only 4% have access to a fully functional toilet with a flush and sewer system. This is why diseases like diarrhea, cholera and shigella are widely transmitted through fecal-oral transmission. Diarrhea has a strong presence in Ethiopia and is highly prevalent in children under 5, with 57% having untreated diarrhea in the entire country and 52% just in the SNNPR (Alemu et al., 2023). The National Library of Medicine states that diarrhea can be caused by several factors, including unprotected sources of water, limited or no access to clean toilet/handwashing facilities. (Feleke et al., 2022). Diarrhea is commonly caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites (Feleke et al., 2022).  In addition, Cholera is another bacterial disease that leads to diarrhea. It is spred by ingesting contaminated water and food (CDC, 2018). Fecal matter can also transmit this disease, especially in areas with poor sanitation, limited access to clean water, and inadequate hygiene (CDC, 2018). In Ethiopia, between August 2022 and November 2023, there was an outbreak of cholera resulting in 26,398 cases and 362 deaths (OCHA, 2023).  Along with Cholera, Shigella spreads through contaminated food, water, objects, and fecal matter (CDC, 2019). In Ethiopia, the rate of Shigella for children under the age of 5, varies from 4.3% to 45% (Hayamo et al., 2021), which can show elevated levels of contagiousness. Toilet paper made from agricultural waste can reduce the risk of bacterial cross-contamination with water sources. The toilet paper itself can help in improving hygiene standards, by preventing bacteria from spreading through fecal to oral transmission.
